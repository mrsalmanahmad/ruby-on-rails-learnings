What You'll Be Fixing
We’re going to reinforce our knowledge of Ruby best practices by refactoring some existing code. As mentioned, refactoring is the process by which we improve a code’s structure, appearance, and/or performance without modifying its overall behavior.

The code in the editor is a Ruby method, first_n_primes, that takes a number n and generates a list of the first n prime numbers. Unfortunately, our poor author hasn’t yet mastered all the tools available in Ruby. But we can fix that!



require 'prime'   # This is a module. We'll cover these soon!

def first_n_primes(n)
  return "n must be an integer." unless n.is_a? Integer
  return "n must be greater than 0." if n <= 0
  return Prime.first n
end

puts first_n_primes(10)

Less is More
Great work! This code looks better already.

We can remove even more, however. There’s one return statement in this code that we can change from explicit to implicit!

Recall that Ruby will automatically return the value of the last expression it evaluates.

require 'prime'   # This is a module. We'll cover these soon!

def first_n_primes(n)
  return "n must be an integer." unless n.is_a? Integer
  return "n must be greater than 0." unless n > 0
  Prime.first n
end

first_n_primes(10)
